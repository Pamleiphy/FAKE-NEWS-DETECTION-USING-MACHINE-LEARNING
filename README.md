# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

Detect whether a news article is real or fake using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.
This project uses Logistic Regression and TF-IDF for text classification and is deployed with Streamlit for a simple web interface.


Main steps:
Data collection
Text preprocessing (NLP)
TF-IDF feature extraction
Model training (Logistic Regression)
Web deployment via Streamlit


‚úÖ Features
Classify news as REAL or FAKE
Simple web app using Streamlit
Runs locally in Jupyter or as a standalone app
High accuracy on test data (‚âà98%)
Lightweight and easy to extend
